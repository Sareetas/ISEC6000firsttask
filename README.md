ISEC6000firsttask

The first task of the SecureDevOps assignment includes a general overview of Saleor architecture. For this, I created a Kubernetes Cluster on GKE (or equivalent tool) by logging into my Google Cloud Console, navigating to the Kubernetes Engine section, and clicking "Create Cluster.". I configured the cluster settings, including the cluster name, location, and node pool configuration. After that, the desired version of Kubernetes was chosen to create the GKE cluster.
After creating the GKE cluster, the local environment is configured to interact with this cluster using Kubectl. I clicked the "Connect" button next to the designed cluster and copied the command line from the clipboard to run in the cloud shell.
I have logged in to my GitHub account and set up a public ISEC6000firsttask GitHub repository to store my project file. The initial setup code for Google Cloud Console was pushed to the GitHub repository.
